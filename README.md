## Purpose

One of the most important facts about white wine is it is known as the preventer of heart diseases. On the other hand, some people think red wine helps people to have a longer lifespan. In this project, we would like to predict the quality of red and white wine based on the feature classes that were provided in our data-set such as pH, alcohol, residual sugar and chlorides. Our data-set is from UCI and consists of 12 attributes for each data entry. We are planning to start some exploration throughout our data and make sure to have a balanced data-set to avoid over-fitting and under-fitting problems. After data cleaning, we will try to find out which features have the most impact on our prediction by visualizing data. Then we are planning to use three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, linear regression and SVM to make classification. At the end, we are going to conclude our data exploration by comparing the result of each model and create the best graphs possible to compare our results. Also we will use different prediction metrics like MSE and accuracy to obtain better results.

## Dataset

The data-set was downloaded from UC Irvine machine learning data-set. My team is going to use some supervise machine learning techniques to predict which wine is more better based on the data that was gather from north of Portugal winery "Vinho Verde". The content of the data-set is the fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, ans sulphates.
